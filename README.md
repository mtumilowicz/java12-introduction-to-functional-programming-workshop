* workshops are in `workshop` package
    * `Step1_LoopTest` - loop that we will refactor in 6 steps
    * `Step2_Split_Workshop` - split loop into many small functions
    * `Step3_Recursion_Workshop` - use recursion
        * `Step3P_Recursion_Workshop` - use vavr API
    * `Step4_FlatMap_Workshop` - abstract common functionality into `flatMap`
    * `Step5_Reduce_Workshop` - abstract `flatMap` to `reduce`
    * `Step6_Filter_Map_Workshop` - implement `filter` and `map` using `flatMap`
    * `Step7_Streams_Answer` - implement using java's Stream API
* answers with correctly implemented workshop methods are in 
`answers` package
